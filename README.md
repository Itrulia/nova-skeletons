> CSS Utility library to create beautiful skeleton screens

This CSS utility library allows you to create beautiful skeleton screens without much hassle. It has been built for simplicity and maintainability.

## Installing / Getting started

To install it you need to require it like this:

```shell
npm install --save @itrulia/nova-skeletons
```

This will add the @itrulia/nova-skeletons dependency in to your package.json.

Now you can either import the SCSS or the CSS depending on what preprocessor you are using (or not using). 

You can do this by in SCSS like this:

```scss
@import "node_modules/@itrulia/nova-skeletons/skeletons";
```

Or add it to your HTML like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/node_modules/@itrulia/nova-skeletons/skeletons.css">
```

## How to use

You should attach the base class `c-skeleton` to the root of your skeleton screen HTML. While this class has no styles attached to it, you can use it if you need to increase the specifity of your CSS if needed. + It also helps to keep the HTML a little bit more grouped.

### Text

The simplest skeleton you can create is one of text that is loading. For this we can use the `c-skeleton__text` class.

```html
<div class="c-skeleton">
    <div class="c-skeleton__text"></div>
</div>
```

#### Modifiers

```css
/* Removes the margin on top/bottom of the text */
.c-skeleton__text--small-height {...}

/* Makes the display style inline block */
.c-skeleton__text--inline {...}

/* Makes the text width full width */
.c-skeleton__text--full {...}

/* Makes the text width big */
.c-skeleton__text--big {...}

/* Makes the text width bigger */
.c-skeleton__text--bigger {...}

/* Makes the text width small */
.c-skeleton__text--small {...}

/* Makes the text width smaller */
.c-skeleton__text--smaller {...}

/* Makes the text width very tiny */
.c-skeleton__text--tiny {...}
```

### Image / Video / etc.

If you want to skeleton an image/video, you can use the class `c-skeleton__figure`. This class adjusts to the parents width and height.

```html
<div class="c-skeleton" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;">
    <div class="c-skeleton__figure"></div>
</div>
```

**Pro tip**: If the non loading state has a border radius, you simply can add a class to it that adds the border radius to the skeleton aswell. In most cases, the skeleton can have the same classes attached as the loaded state!

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Itrulia/nova-skeletons
cd nova-skeletons/
npm install
```

This will download all dependencies so that you are ready to go.

### Deploying / Publishing

You will need to publish this to the github and npm repository.

To do this you will need to do the following steps:

* As soon as you are done with development (don't forget the tests if necessary please ;) ) please commit your code
* After that you will need to update the version number of the package.json, please do this via the [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) tool. Don't forget to set the correct version number according to the [SEMVER](http://semver.org/) guidelines.
* Please push your code to master now and set a tag (same version as you set earlier) with a `v` prefix (e.g. `v1.1.0`) and add release notes for what has changed so everyone knows what to do when there are breaking changes and what has changed for them.
* Now you are ready to publish it to the npm repository. You can do this via `npm publish`. Further information can be founde on the official [npm documentation page](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish).

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

To make it easier for everyone to contribute to this project and understand it,
please always update the documentation when you create or modify anything.

Also always try to improve atleast 1 small thing when you are already there so that over time
the project gets better and better, this is also known as [The Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule).
